The Nautilus DevOps team has put some data on all app servers in Stratos DC. 
jump host is configured as Puppet master server, and all app servers are already been configured as Puppet agent nodes. 
The team needs to update the content of some of the exiting files, as well as need to update their permissions etc. 
Please find below more details about the task:



Create a Puppet programming file official.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory on the master node i.e Jump Server. 
Using puppet file resource, perform the below mentioned tasks.

A file named media.txt already exists under /opt/finance directory on App Server 3.

Add content Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries! in media.txt file on App Server 3.

Set its permissions to 0655.

Notes: :- Please make sure to run the puppet agent test using sudo on agent nodes, otherwise you can face certificate issues. 
In that case you will have to clean the certificates first and then you will be able to run the puppet agent test.


node 'stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com' {
file { '/opt/finance/media.txt':
      content => 'Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries!',
      mode => '0655'
    }

}
