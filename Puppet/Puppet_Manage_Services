New packages need to be installed on some of the app servers in Stratos Datacenter. 
The Nautilus DevOps team has decided to install the same using Puppet. 
Since jump host is already configured to run as Puppet master server and all app servers are already configured to work as puppet agent nodes, 
we need to create the required manifests on the Puppet master server so that it can be applied on the required Puppet agent node. 
Please find more details about the task below.



Create a Puppet programming file beta.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory on master node 
i.e Jump Host to perform the below given tasks.

Install package tomcat using puppet package resource and start its service using puppet service resource on Puppet agent node 2 i.e App Server 2.

class tomcat_installer {

    package {'tomcat':

        ensure => installed

    }

    service {'tomcat':

        ensure    => running,

        enable    => true,

    }

}

node 'stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com', 'stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com', 'stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com' {

  include tomcat_installer

}
