Some new changes need to be made on some of the app servers in Stratos Datacenter. 
There are some packages that need to be installed on the app server 3. 
We want to install these packages using puppet only.



Puppet master is already installed on Jump Server.

Create a puppet programming file media.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests on master node 
i.e on Jump Server and perform below mentioned tasks using the same.

Define a class multi_package_node for agent node 3 i.e app server 3. 
Install net-tools and unzip packages on the agent node 3.

Notes: :- Please make sure to run the puppet agent test using sudo on agent nodes, 
otherwise you can face certificate issues. 
In that case you will have to clean the certificates first and then you will be able to run the puppet agent test.


class multi_package_node {

$multi_package = [ 'net-tools', 'unzip']

    package { $multi_package: ensure => 'installed' }

}



node 'stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com' {

  include multi_package_node
}
