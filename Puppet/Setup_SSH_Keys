The Puppet master and Puppet agent nodes have been set up by the Nautilus DevOps team to perform some testing. 
In Stratos DC all app servers have been configured as Puppet agent nodes. 
They want to setup a password less SSH connection between Puppet master and Puppet agent nodes and this task needs to be done using Puppet itself. 
Below are details about the task:

Create a Puppet programming file apps.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory on the Puppet master 
node i.e on Jump Server. 
Define a class ssh_node1 for agent node 1 i.e App Server 1, ssh_node2 for agent node 2 i.e App Server 2, ssh_node3 for agent node3 i.e App Server 3. 
You will need to generate a new ssh key for thor user on Jump Server, that needs to be added on all App Servers.

Configure a password less SSH connection from puppet master i.e jump host to all App Servers. 
However, please make sure the key is added to the authorized_keys file of each app's sudo user (i.e tony for App Server 1).

ssh-keygen

sudo vi /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/apps.pp
