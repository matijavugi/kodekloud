There is an application that needs to be deployed on Kubernetes cluster under Apache web server. The Nautilus application development team has asked the DevOps team to deploy it. We need to develop a template as per requirements mentioned below:



Create a namespace named as httpd-namespace-datacenter.

Create a deployment named as httpd-deployment-datacenter under newly created namespace. For the deployment use httpd image with latest tag only and remember to mention the tag i.e httpd:latest, and make sure replica counts are 2.

Create a service named as httpd-service-datacenter under same namespace to expose the deployment, nodePort should be 30004.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.


kubectl create ns httpd-namespace-datacenter

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  namespace: httpd-namespace-datacenter
  name: httpd-deployment-datacenter
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: httpd-app
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      name: httpd-deployment-datacenter
      labels:
        app: httpd-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: httpd:latest
        name: httpd
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  namespace: httpd-namespace-datacenter
  name: httpd-service-datacenter
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: httpd-app
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30004
