The Nautilus DevOps team has started practicing some pods, 
and services deployment on Kubernetes platform as they are planning to migrate most of their applications
on Kubernetes platform. Recently one of the team members has been assigned a task to create a deploymnt 
as per details mentioned below:


Create a deployment named httpd to deploy the application httpd using the image httpd:latest
